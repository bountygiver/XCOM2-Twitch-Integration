TODO: Add dependency on Highlander

4:58 PM] Tombk💀met: Some ideas off top of my head, idk if it's possible
	- Ayy reinforcements
	- LOST pod
	- summon chryssalids
	- resurrect dead bodies as zombies
	- summon Chosen
	- add a lot of civilians on the map, who take up best cover spots
	- all the windows become anti-XCOM windows, can't vault through them
	- summon friendly but careless resistance squad
	- random soldier panics
	- call in artillery bombardment on random XCOM soldier - will land in a turn, or perhaps two
	- grant extra move(s) to random aliens currently fighting
