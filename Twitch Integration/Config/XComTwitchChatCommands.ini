; This file contains configuration related to all of the chat commands which
; viewers can use. Individual commands can be enabled or disabled, and you can
; change how they're used (ex: you can change 'xsay' to 'xtalk'), which may be
; useful if a command conflicts with an existing chat command from Moobot or similar.
;
; Individual commands may expose additional configuration in this file as well.

[TwitchIntegration.TwitchStateManager]

; This is a list of commands which are enabled for chatters to use. See the individual
; commands below for their documentation and how to invoke them.
+EnabledCommands=TwitchCommandHandler_ExecuteAction
+EnabledCommands=TwitchCommandHandler_Vote
+EnabledCommands=TwitchCommandHandler_XSay



[TwitchIntegration.UIChatLog]
TimeToShowOnMessageReceived=0.0f ; How long to show the chat log after receiving a message, before collapsing it to the side automatically. If <= 0,
                                 ; the chat log will not collapse automatically. Regardless of this setting, you can always click a button to expand
                                 ; or collapse the chat log manually.



; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Command:     Vote
; Usable by:   all viewers whenever a poll is active
; Syntax:      vote <optionNumber>
;
; Casts a vote in a poll. If you've disabled polls in XComTwitchEvents.ini, this command will never do anything.
; Note that at this time, viewers cannot change their vote once cast.
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[TwitchIntegration.TwitchCommandHandler_Vote]
+CommandAliases=vote ; Don't change this, it's hardcoded on the UI!



; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Command:     XSay
; Usable by:   viewers with units in the current tactical mission
; Syntax:      xsay <message>
;
; Sends a chat message to show in-game. If the viewer sending the message does not own a unit in the current
; mission, their message is ignored.
;
; This command supports a bunch of configuration related to how the message is displayed and when messages
; are allowed.

[TwitchIntegration.TwitchCommandHandler_XSay]
+CommandAliases=xsay
+CommandAliases=say

bRequireUnitInLOS=false ; If true, chat messages from enemies will be ignored if the enemy is not currently in LOS of XCOM. Even if this is false, messages will
                        ; not pan the camera to the unit if the unit is not in LOS, to avoid spoiling enemy positions. Additionally, if using the chat log, the
                        ; message will only show the chatter's name and not what enemy type their unit is if the unit is not in LOS.

bShowToast=false        ; If true, a notification toast will pop up on the right side of the screen (similar to soldier promotion messages) with the chat message.
                        ; Messages will be truncated to 45 characters to fit within the toast.

bShowFlyover=false      ; If true, when chat messages are received, a popup will occur over the unit which said it (similar to the popup when a unit is revealed
                        ; or disoriented). The camera may pan to the unit, depending on the value of LookAtDuration below. Panning removes control of the camera
                        ; from the player while it's happening, so strongly consider turning it off if your chat is fairly active.
                        ; Messages will be truncated to 45 characters to fit within the flyover.

LookAtDuration=0        ; How long, in seconds, to look at a character when chat is submitted. If negative, the camera will not move when !xsay is used;
                        ; if positive, the camera will move to the character and stay there for the specified duration; and if 0, the camera will remain
                        ; on the character for a length of time automatically determined based on the length of the chat message.
                        ; Characters not currently visible to your squad will never be panned to regardless of this value.
                        ; No effect if bShowFlyover is false.
